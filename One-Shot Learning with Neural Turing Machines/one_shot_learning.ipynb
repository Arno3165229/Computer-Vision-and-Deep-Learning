Suppose we have an input batch of 16 episodes of image samples, with each episode being of equal length of 50. Based on the design of the rest of the project (which we have already implemented for you), MANNCell should be called 50 times, each time having 16 input samples (along with the offseted labels), and outputting 16 output labels. More specifically, the MANNCell should produce classification labels $[\\hat{y}_0^t, ..., \\hat{y}_{15}^t]$ for all 16 iteration-$t$ image samples batch $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y_0^t, ..., x^t_{15}+y_{14}^t]$ (\"+\" means concatenation) every time it is called; for your information, it is the class NTMOneShotLearningModel (already implemented below) that actually calls MANNCell 50 times. Your job is to make sure that at a single iteration $t$ (where $t=0,1,2,...,49$), MANNCell correctly parses the input arguments, produce the correct read and write weights $w^r_t, w^w_t$, correctly retrieve from and write to the memory to form $M_t$, and use the right material to get the logits for classification (they will be used for computing the labels and cross-entropy values in NTMOneShotLearningModel), and return the right states that will be used in the next iteration $t+1$. \n",

The read vector , which combined with weight vector and memory matrix in a linear way. There are two types of addressing mechanisms to access information from the memory in NTM. One is the Content-based addressing and the other one is the Location-based addressing. However, MANN uses a new addressing schema called least recently used access. The idea behind the scene is that the least recently used memory location is determined by the read operation and the read operation is performed by content-based addressing. So, it basically perform content-based addressing for reading and write to the location that was least recently used.\n",

        "Ans: We could. But I think our implementation and results are acceptable unless we have much more time and want to get the best results.\n",

        "[c]: Maybe we should have written to the memory before reading from it? \n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: No. If we do, we couldn't get the previous memory because the new memory will cover the previous one. \n",
        "\n",
        "[d]: Maybe a better measure of similarity than the cosine similarity in computing the reading weights?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Cosine similarity is calculated using only the dot product and magnitude of each vector, and is therefore affected only by the terms the two vectors have in common. It could only get the angle of vectors not the magnitude. So we can measure the Euclidean distance between the two vectors by applying a Gaussian kernal. This similarity could be written as $K(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{l}) = exp(-\\frac{||\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{l}||^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}})$\n",

        "[e]: Does zeroing out the least used memory slot from before really make sense?\n",

        "[f]: A better mechanism of writing to memory than the “least recently used access”?\n",

        "[g]: Is there any hope of utilizing the experience and intuition we gained about NTMs and the one-shot learning task here on normal classification problems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Yes. The keypoint of NTM and the one-shot learning task here is the way of using a memory. The memory could be seen like a hidden state in RNN. Even though it can only address a few classes and couldn't get the best performance compared with other NN methods, it still can be a transfer learning method for normal classification problems. Or maybe we even could do some extension or improve the model like reinforcing the model complexity to get a better performance.\n",
